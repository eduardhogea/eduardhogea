![header](https://capsule-render.vercel.app/api?type=wave&color=auto&height=300&section=header&text=Big%20Data%20and%20AI%20Enthusiast&fontSize=40)

Hacking my way through life as a second-year Master's student specializing in **Big Data** . Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and constantly honing my skills.

## üåç My Exchange Experiences

- üá¶üáπ Spent one semester as an exchange student in Linz, Austria at **Johannes Kepler University** during my bachelor's degree.
- üá™üá∏ Studied in Barcelona for a year at **Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona**, focused on Computer Vision.

## üé§ Conferences and Awards

- [SYNASC](https://synasc.ro) - At this international conference, I delivered a presentation on the comparative analysis of Deep Learning methods and Neuro-symbolic approaches. I highlighted how the integration of First Order Logic with a deep learning model as the backbone enhances the performance of neuro-symbolic systems. A post-conference paper published by IEEE is available.
- [Sesiunea de Comunicari Stiintifice Studentesti](https://sites.google.com/e-uvt.ro/concursultraianlalescu/acas%C4%83) - I was honored with an award for demonstrating the practical applications of neuro-symbolic models in the realm of cybersecurity. My research focused on training models using datasets employed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
- [Smart Diaspora](https://www.diaspora-stiintifica.ro/) - Was invited to exhibit my poster outlining the advancements in the neuro-symbolic domain of AI, as well as to discuss the progress of my publications in collaboration with my supervising professor. Event, under the high patronage of the President of Romania.
